# my-spotify

## Tech Stack 
* vite 
* elm lang
* tailwindcss 
* prisma
* planet scale
* railway / vercel

## Problems 
* `prisma` needed to be installed as a dev depencency
* vite elm comilation does not like file paths with spaces eg: `C:\Farooq Khan\my-spotify\client\Main.elm` is not read but instead `C:\Farooq` is read by the compiler.
